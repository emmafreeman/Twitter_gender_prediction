# Twitter gender prediction

This is my capstone project for the Data Science Immersive at General Assembly. I pulled about one million tweets from 10,000 random gender-tagged users equally distributed between males and females. I used natural language processing and machine learning models to determine the most predictive features (words and emojis) for male and female tweets, and built a model to predict the gender of a Twitter user based on tweets. The project uses Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn), the Twitter API, Amazon Web Services, MongoDB, and Jupyter notebooks.

For a more detailed description of this project see the Report file in this repository.

(This project is in progress.)
