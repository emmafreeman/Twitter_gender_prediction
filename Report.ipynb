They had volunteers categorize each profile/user as \"male\", ‚Äúfemale,‚Äù ‚Äúbrand or organization,‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt tell‚Äù. They then made a model to predict gender or brand based on the text of the tweets and the color of the profile background, and achieved a 60% predictive accuracy with their model. They also identified the most important features for each category.  https://www.crowdflower.com/using-machine-learning-to-predict-gender/"
